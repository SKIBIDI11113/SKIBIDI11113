        <b>I. Summary of the Stream:</b>
        <br>
The livestream started with a lively introduction of the members. Before heading into the introduction itself, the streamers have gathered a total of 17 viewers as they have reposted their promotional materials minutes before they start their livestream. The stream went conversational as planned. The streamers focused on the disadvantages and advantages of AI generated art, as they have planned on doing a neutral point of view of the said topic. Given that the stream had to be conversational rather than adding more information like before, the streamers also shared their personal experiences and opinions about AI generated art or AI generators. At the end of the stream, 4 of the hosts shared the new things they have learned to end the stream.

        <b>II. Successful Parts of the Stream</b>
            <br>
            One of the successful parts of the livestream was the chat box feature. On the group’s last stream, the streamers weren’t able to add the chat box resulting in a less organized and neat stream overlay. Secondly, the presentation of the slides is much more organized this time. Lastly, the streamers were able to tackle all the topics within an hour, which is much lengthy than the stream before, resulting in following the given stream outline that the members have created.

  <b>III. Parts of the Stream that could be worked on
</b>
<br>          
           The audio quality of the stream could have been improved, as well as the navigation of the slides presentation. Though the group had technical support, there were times that there were lapses or a gray area in the stream. The duration of each member's speaking could also have been improved so that there will be a fair amount of distribution.

  <b>IV. Stream Engagement
</b>
<br>  
<br>  
<br>      
           The engagement in our stream was surprisingly higher than our last stream. During the waiting of our stream, we reached above 15 viewers. Which is something that our last stream hadn’t received. When the stream started, the views increased further and we wasted no time on starting immediately as we streamed 7 minutes late. The engagement during the icebreaker is also adequate as the audience are very cooperative, though we couldn’t avoid a few individuals who didn’t take our stream seriously. But as mentioned, we could’ve improved on having a fair distribution of the member’s moments to speak. Overall, the stream engagement was larger than our previous stream and the streamers enjoyed the time spent together.

  <b>V. High or Low viewership
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>          At the end of our stream, we gathered 125 viewers in total. We can say that we are very satisfied with that number of viewers.  As you can see, there have been some improvements since our first stream had a low viewership. We trusted the process like we said in our first stream that we believed that taking baby steps is a part of success. 
The reason why we had a higher viewership was because we changed the design of our promotional material which is a poster; we posted it to our IG, and FB account we shared this to our friends, classmates, & etc.
